Custom Homebrew Tap
===================

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap nocturnalfrog/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from another tap, you can `brew install nocturnalfrog/tap/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/nocturnalfrog/homebrew-tap/master/<formula>.rb
```
